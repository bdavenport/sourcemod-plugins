# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
    tags: [ release/* ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]
    tags: [ release/* ]
# TODO: At somepoint master should be release/*    

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    name: Build plugins
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
    
    # Check out the 1.10-dev sourcemod to compile from
    #- name: Checkout sourcemod 1.10-dev
    #  uses: actions/checkout@1.10-dev
    #  with:
    #    repository: alliedmodders/sourcemod #

    - name: What do we have part 1
      run: ls -al

    # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: What do we have part 2
      run: ls -al


    # Runs a single command using the runners shell
    - name: Run a one-line script
      run: echo Hello, world!

    # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
    - name: Run a multi-line script
      run: |
        echo Add other actions to build,
        echo test, and deploy your project.
